          <section class="content"><p>Hello #{static_site_blog} world. First post in the new site. I&#39;ve been on a bit of a journey for the last few years retooling myself towards the modern web. Its an amazing place! Last time I was active on this blog, it was about Flash, <span class="caps">AIR</span>, and mobile development. This time, I hope to cover full-stack web development, design, and well, whatever else seems appropriate for the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;ve been exploring <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith.io</a>, a static site blogging platform built via Node.js. I‘m excited about it as it supports Coffeescript, my web development language of choice. I’ve been working on a few Rails projects, and while I really like Ruby, the single-language Javascript runtime‘s advantages tipped the scale as to where I want to focus. Its super simple. If you’re interested in looking at the source, you can find it <a href="http://www.github.com/dwabyick/wabysabi.io">on Github</a>.</p>
