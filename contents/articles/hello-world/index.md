Hello #{static_site_blog} world. First post in the new site. I've been on a bit of a journey for the last few years retooling myself towards the modern web. Its an amazing place! Last time I was active on this blog, it was about Flash, AIR, and mobile development. This time, I hope to cover full-stack web development, design, and well, whatever else seems appropriate for the time.

Currently, I've been exploring [Wintersmith.io][0], a static site blogging platform built via Node.js. I'm excited about it as it supports Coffeescript, my web development language of choice. I've been working on a few Rails projects, and while I really like Ruby, the single-language Javascript runtime's advantages tipped the scale as to where I want to focus. Its super simple. If you're interested in looking at the source, you can find it [on Github][1].
